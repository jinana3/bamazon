### What the project does?

This is an Amazon-like storefront application that runs in node, with MySQL as backend database. The app should take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store. 

Currently the app is a development in progress. The Customer interface is done, but work is still be completed for Manager and Supervisor.
